# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

The types of problems that are best solved using recursion are problems where a decisions is being made. For example, binary search would be a good problem to use recursions as it will continue until it finds the value that is being invoked. Other problems that are best solved using recursion is traversing through data structures that are recursive in nature, like linked list, graphs, and trees.

# Teacher Feedback
