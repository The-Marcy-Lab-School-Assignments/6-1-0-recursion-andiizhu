# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer

The benefits are writing function recursively is that it can be easier to read compared to for loops because the recursive case breaks down the function to the simplest problem. This may make it more elegant and concise. It is also ideal for traversing through recursive data structures such as linked list, graphs and trees.

The drawbacks to recursion functions is can be inefficient and consume too much space as each recursive case relies on calling function, which will add to the call stack. As a result, recursion will take up more memory and will be generally slower compare to writing the function iteratively. In addition, if the recursion function is not properly written, it can create a stack overflow as the recursive cases continue to add new functions to the call stack. Lastly, recursions can be harder to read if it is over-complicating simple iterative problems.
