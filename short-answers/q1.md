# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

A recursive function is a function that invokes itself in the code block. The "cases" that exist in a recursive functions are the "base case" and "recursive case." The "base case" is like the stopping condition of the recursive function or it is used to show when the recursion should end. The "recursive" case is what is invoked for each recursion until it reaches the "base case." If there is no "base case," the recursive function will cause an infinite loop as it doesn't have a stopping condition.
